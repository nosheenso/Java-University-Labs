# Java-University-Labs
This lab is focused on the following: creating a custom class with relevant instance variables, adding a constructor and getter and setter methods to a class, instantiating objects of a custom class, identifying when and how to add toString() and equals() method to a class, and documenting code thoroughly to generate clear Javadocs.
